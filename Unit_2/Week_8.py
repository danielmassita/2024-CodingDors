# IA's Solutions
# Certainly! Here's an alternative solution using dictionary comprehension:
def create_dictionary(name, age):
    return {name: age}
# This solution is more concise and uses dictionary comprehension to directly create and return the dictionary with the key-value pair of 'name' and 'age'. It achieves the same result as the original solution but in a more compact form.
