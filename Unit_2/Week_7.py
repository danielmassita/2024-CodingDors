print_to_n_for_loop
Show Solution
Write a Python function that takes an integer n as input and returns a list that contains all numbers from 0 to n inclusive, using a for loop.
print_to_n_for_loop(5) -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_to_n_for_loop(3) -> [0, 1, 2, 3]
print_to_n_for_loop(1) -> [0, 1]

Theory
print_to_n_for_loop
1. For loop: A loop is a programming structure that repeats a block of code until a specific condition is met. 'for' loop is used to iterate over a sequence or until a certain condition is met. Example: 
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
2. List: A list is a collection of values that are ordered and changeable. Lists are one of the most commonly used data types in Python. Example:
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(my_list)
3. Function: A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks.  Example:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
my_function()
4. Range: 'range()' is a built-in function in python used to generate a sequence of numbers. It is often used with 'for' loop to iterate over the sequence.  Example:
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
Output:
0
1
2
5. List append: The 'append()' method is used to add elements to the end of a list. Example:
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
my_list.append("orange")
print(my_list)
Output:
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

Hint
print_to_n_for_loop
1. Start by defining a function called "print_to_n_for_loop" that takes in a single parameter, n. 
2. Create an empty list inside the function to store the numbers. 
3. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to n (inclusive). 
4. Append each number to the list inside the loop. 
5. Return the list at the end of the function.
